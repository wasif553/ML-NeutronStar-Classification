# ML-NeutronStar-Classification
Code and data for the paper: Exploring the Limits of Machine-Learning Classification of Neutron-Star Matter Models.

This repository contains the computational framework and synthetic datasets for the paper: 
"Exploring the Limits of Machine-Learning Classification of Neutron-Star Matter Models".

Overview
We provide a machine-learning pipeline to classify four distinct families of neutron star equations of state (EoS) using macroscopic and oscillation observables (M, R, f, Q, z, \tau, h_c).

How to Reproduce Results
1. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the analysis:
   `python reproduce_all_figures.py`
3. Generate QMC data
   QMC.jl
